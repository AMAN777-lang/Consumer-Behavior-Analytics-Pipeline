# Consumer Behavior Analytics Pipeline

## 📊 Project Overview
This project explores consumer shopping behavior for a large retail company aiming to improve sales, customer satisfaction, and long-term loyalty. The goal is to uncover key drivers of purchasing decisions—such as discounts, reviews, seasonality, and payment preferences—and translate those insights into actionable strategies.

## 🧭 Business Problem
> "How can we use consumer shopping data to identify trends, improve engagement, and optimize marketing strategies?"

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies
- **Excel** – Initial data exploration and sanity checks
- **Python (VS Code)** – Data cleaning, transformation, and feature engineering
- **MySQL Workbench** – Structured storage and SQL-based analysis
- **Power BI** – Interactive dashboards to visualize patterns and drive decisions

## 🛠️ Workflow Summary
1. **Data Profiling**: Used Excel to inspect raw data, identify missing values, and detect anomalies.
2. **Data Transformation**: Applied Python (Pandas, NumPy) to clean and engineer features like discount impact, seasonality flags, and review scores.
3. **Database Structuring**: Loaded transformed data into MySQL with normalized schema for efficient querying.
4. **SQL Analysis**: Ran queries to segment customers, analyze repeat purchases, and uncover behavioral trends.
5. **Dashboarding**: Designed Power BI dashboards with filters for demographics, channels, and time periods.

## 🔍 Key Insights
